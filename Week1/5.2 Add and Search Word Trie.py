#Using Trie

"""
In trie, each path from the root to the "word" node represents one of the input words, for example, o -> a -> t -> h is "oath".

Trie implementation is pretty straightforward, it's basically nested hashmaps. At each step, one has to verify, if the child node to add is already present. If yes, just go one step down. If not, add it into the trie and then go one step down.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(M) for the "well-defined" words without dots, where MM is the key length, and N is a number of keys, and O(Mâ‹…N) for the "undefined" words. That corresponds to the worst-case situation of searching an undefined word (M + 1) times which is one character longer than all inserted keys.

Space complexity: O(1) for the search of "well-defined" words without dots, and up to \mathcal{O}(M)O(M) for the "undefined" words, to keep the recursion stack.
